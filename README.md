# Exegesis App

This app is a simple frontend for the Exegesis project. 
It allows you to create and update documents and issues in the Exegesis repository.
All content is publically visible.
Accepted authors can publish new content and propose changes to existing content.
**Any** user can file an _issue_ which essentially opens a discussion about the content.
